def maxSubarrayProduct(arr, n):
    result = arr[0]  # start with first element as max product

    for i in range(n):         # start index of sub-array
        mul = arr[i]           # start the product with current element

        for j in range(i + 1, n):  # extend sub-array to the right
            result = max(result, mul)  # update max product found so far
            mul *= arr[j]             # multiply current element

        result = max(result, mul)  # check the last product too

    return result







Output:
Maximum sub-array product is 112
Because the subarray [7, -8, -2] gives the product 7 × -8 × -2 = 112.
